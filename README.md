🌍 Family Tracker

This Project is the Advanced version of my initial Travel Tracker Project which rendered visited Countries of a single user.The Advance version allows families to collaboratively track their global adventures.

Family Tracker is a web-based application that allows families to collaboratively track their global adventures. Each family member can be added to the map, assigned a unique color, and have their visited countries shaded accordingly—making it easy to visualize travel histories and shared experiences.

✨ Features

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Add Family Members: Create individual profiles for each family member.
🎨 Assign Unique Colors: Choose a distinct color for each member to visually distinguish their travels.
🗺️ Interactive World Map: Select visited countries, and they’ll be shaded in the assigned color.
📌 Shared & Individual Tracking: See who visited where—individually or overlapping travel zones with blended colors.
🚀 How It Works

Add your family members with names and select a color.
Click on countries on the map to mark them as visited for any member.
The countries will be shaded based on the selected member’s color.
